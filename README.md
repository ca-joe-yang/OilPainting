Oil Painting Algorithm
===
# Introduction
- `main_1.py` is a python3 implementation of this blog: [Oil Painting Algorithm](http://supercomputingblog.com/graphics/oil-painting-algorithm/)
- `main_2.py` is a python3 implementation of this paper: [CLD-shaped Brushstrokes in Non-Photorealistic Rendering](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1002/1002.4317.pdf)

# How to run?
```bash
python3 main_1.py <INPUT_IMAGE>
python3 main_2.py <INPUT_IMAGE>
```
- both will output an oil-painting effect image `result.jpg`# OilPainting
